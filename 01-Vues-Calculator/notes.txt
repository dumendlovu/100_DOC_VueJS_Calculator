The Build Calculator App Tutorial
#Lessons of the Day
- A chance to brush up on CSS grid
- To learn the use of Vue.js and how it all works
#Realisations
- I'll probably be done with this in 2 days because
  $ I'm not going to follow the Tutorial and Leave because
    *I want to fix some of the bugs
    * Make some changes to give my own personal flare
    * Potential improve on some of the design.
